# Prosthetics Material Testing Platform

A simulation-based platform for testing and evaluating materials for use in prosthetics. This project aims to help researchers identify the best materials for creating lightweight, durable, and skin-friendly prosthetic solutions.

## Features

- **Material Database**: Add and manage different materials with their physical properties
- **Test Simulation**: Run various tests on selected materials to evaluate their performance
- **Performance Visualization**: View and interpret test results with interactive charts
- **Material Comparison**: Compare different materials to find the optimal choice for specific prosthetic applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prosthetics-material-testing.git
cd prosthetics-material-testing
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```
npm start
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
